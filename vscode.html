  <h2>What are Pugs?</h2>
  <p>If you've ever been walking down the street and seen a stout little dog with a flat face and curly tail that looks like it belongs to a pig, you may have seen a Pug! Pugs are small, sturdy dogs with curly tails, round heads and thick necks. They also have flat, wrinkly faces and large, dark eyes. Their legs are short, and they have small, droopy ears. Their short fur is soft and shiny. They are either black or tan with a black face.</p>
  <p>
    Pugs are purebreds, meaning their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and so on were all Pugs, too. They each have the same features, like those curly tails, and don't have any other kind of dog in their family history. In fact, Pugs are one of the oldest purebred dog breeds!
  </p>
  <p>
    Pugs are small dogs that weigh between 14 and 18 pounds when they are full grown, and can live to be about 15 years old. That's 73 in human years!

  <h2>Where did Pugs Come From?</h2>
  <p>The first place Pugs are known to have come from is China more than 2,000 years ago. Pugs lived as pets in monasteries, which were buildings where religious people lived and worshiped. Chinese rulers also valued Pugs, and they lived in very fancy palaces with them. Sometimes Pugs even had their own guards to protect them!</p>
  <p>
    The word Pug may have come from an old word meaning fist, because its head is round and squished and looks like your fist, or from a kind of monkey, the marmoset pug monkey, that looked like the dog. The breed was known as "Lo-sze" or "Foo" in China, and was considered a symbol of good luck and prosperity.</p>

    <p>Pugs were eventually brought to Europe by Dutch traders in the 16th century, and quickly became popular among the aristocracy. They were especially popular in the Netherlands, where they were used as loyal companions and watchdogs.
    In the 19th century, Pugs became popular in England and were recognized by the Kennel Club in 1886. They were also brought to the United States during this time, where they quickly gained a following among dog lovers.</p>
    
   <p> Today, Pugs are a beloved breed around the world and are known for their charming personalities and distinctive appearance. They are often kept as pets and are popular in dog shows and competitions. Despite their small size, Pugs are known for their big personalities and their ability to bring joy and laughter to their owners' lives.</p>
